# burger
(class assignment)

![Da Burger!](/doc/pic.jpg "Da Burger!")

### Where can I try it?
Try it out on Heroku now - [Da Burger](https://secure-cove-86862.herokuapp.com/).

### What items did I try outside of the assignment?
1. TypeScript - Getting more comfortable with it each and every assignment. Spent a good hour learning chaining promises + error handling + TypeScript, especially when you consider a promise can return multiple "types" depending on error condition.
2. Handlebars custom helper function
3. Used a template for the look and feel of the app / kudos to colorlib for the work they did on this free one!
4. Pushed off Jest until the next assignment
